ISI PFE reports LaTeX class file. 
====================================================================

This is a LaTeX class file (and associated style files provided with
the package but falling under different copyright agreements) that
can be used in the preparation of PFE at ISI, Tunis.

The files are distributed as a simple .zip file.  Uncompress with
your favorite decompression utitlity, and you will be presented with
a "isipfe" directory.

Within this directory you will find,

 o Report.tex: the main TeX file 
 o remerciement.tex, resume.tex: frontmatter files
 o chap_intro.tex, chap_xx.tex, chap_conclusion.tex: sample chapter files
 o references.bib: sample BibTeX file
 o Figures: a folder where figures should be put

Edit and add to these as you see fit, don't forget to include extra files in
thesis.tex.
isipfe.cls is the main class file that defines the look, and isipfe.bst
defines the style of the bibliography (generated using the makebst), edit these
to tweak the look. 

isipfe depends on a number of standard packages: {ccaption, quotchap, makeidx, 
natbib, tocbibind, amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb, graphicx, showkeys}, you may need
to either install these packages or comment out the corresponding  \usepackage 
command.

Good luck.
